# common — Asynchronous Decoupling (MQ)

## Overview

Topic: `package-status-topic`

Package status updates move from latency-driven RPC to bandwidth-driven messaging.

Part of the [LogisticsConnect](../README.md) project. Holds the ActiveMQ broker shared
by the services below — not a service itself, so it has no port of its own.

- Producer: `delay-stage-service` (`../delay-stage-service`)
- Consumer(s): `transit-service` (required, stage 3); `alertbot` (stretch, stage 4 —
  reacts to stage changes to decide when to raise an alert)

Broker URL and topic name are shared via a common `co.wethinkcode.logisticsconnect.mq.MqConfig` class
(`BROKER_URL`, `TOPIC`). It's identical in every participating service's own source
tree — each service here is an independent Maven project with no shared parent pom,
so the common package is duplicated rather than imported from one place.

## Project structure

```
common/
├── docker-compose.yml
└── README.md
```

This folder holds the broker config and notes only — the publish/subscribe code
lives in the producer and consumer services (their poms include
`activemq-client`, and each has
`src/main/java/co/wethinkcode/logisticsconnect/mq/MqConfig.java`).

## Build

Nothing to build here directly — this folder just brings up the broker used by the
services listed above.

## Run

```
docker compose up -d
```

- Broker URL for clients: `tcp://localhost:61616`
- Web console: http://localhost:8161 (default admin/admin)

Then start the producer/consumer services as usual (`mvn package && java -jar ...`
from their own directories at the project root).

## Test

```
docker compose ps          # confirm the broker container is running
```

With the broker and services running, update a stage and confirm the Transit
Service logs show it received the event. Then request an ETA and check that it
uses the updated stage. AlertBot should also log a simulated alert when a hub
crosses into stage 5 or higher:

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:7052/delay-stage/H-500 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"stage":5}'
curl http://localhost:7053/eta/H-500
```

Stage messages are JSON objects containing `hubId`, `stage`, and an ISO-8601
`timestamp`.
